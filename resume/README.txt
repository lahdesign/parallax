	This project was done in vscode using html and css to design my resume. I used techniques I learnt in previous classes to design a resume that follows certain typographic rules and has a clear visual hierarchy. I found it challenging to make everything work because if I messed up once it was hard to find the mistake to fix.I	I had trouble using the flex box. I got it to work as best as I could but I am still not pleased with the outcome.
	I learned a lot about html and css while working on this project. I found almost all of the notes and work we have been doing in class helpful but I need to take some time to learn more about flex box.
